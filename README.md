# ScholarUp:
Mobile Application Project - Study Application 

ScholarUp is our study app created for Mobile Applications Development in Fall 2023 and presented at InnovateUNO.

ScholarUp is a combination of studying, planning, and _friendly_ competition. <name placeholder> uses XP from creating flashcards, studying, or mastering a concept to determine where a user would fall on a leaderboard. We implement daily challenges and achievements for those who enjoy the passive challenge.

Tools: Trello, GitHub, SCRUM workflow, 
Languages: React-Native, JavaScript,  

In Progress!
