### Jumana Suleiman
A senior in Computer Science interested in Web and Mobile Application Development, Software Engineering, and leadership. I use planners and calendars to keep track of what I need done, so it will be very interesting to see the process of creating an app like this! You can reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jumana-sul).
UI designed by me: [ScholarUp Prototype](https://github.com/JumanaCS/MY-ART/tree/main/ScholarUp) and [ScholarUp Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17w2G4pYsliUlZ8SEmiXdHXObV6MG3XdAndcf3I_jJzw/edit?usp=sharing).
